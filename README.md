Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly
=============================
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, 
April 29, 11:59 PM PDT, because it must be graded by others. If you submit 
late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This 
makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. 
Submit on time to avoid these risks.

Review criteria
=================
- Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
- Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?
